# Sign Detection
Howdy! ðŸ¤ 

This is a little package I made while in Undergraduate to perform some basic intensity filtering from a LIDAR PointCloud2 message to obtain a filtered pointcloud of street signs.

# Requirements
* ROS-Kinetic (untested with Melodic)
* PCL-ROS

## Setup
Git clone to your `catkin_ws`

Then

```bash
cd catkin_ws
rosdep install rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```

## LIDAR
This package was tested with the Velodnye VLP-16 LIDAR. With the VLP-16, I was reliabily able to detect stop signs from up to 10 meters away. 

In theory, any other LIDAR that outputs a Pointcloud2 message with intensity should work, provided that there is enough points.
